# Running NoteBook
**Suggested using Anaconda for easy execution of notebook**
1. The main file Training_Testing_Master-Final, is the only file thats is to be run. Other ipynb files are different versions so replicated results should be reserved to the former. The datasets needed are all included in the Datasets folder and the file paths will work automatically when running the notebook. 
2. The submission file will include predictions from different test2, all labeled with their respective test number, with 'rental_id' as index and 'predictions' as the other column.

3. Important to have up to date anaconda version and install lightgbm and xgboost using the following commands respectively in the anaconda promt.
- conda install -c conda-forge lightgbm
- conda install -c conda-forge xgboost

4. The schools dataset was created using the external_testing notebook to clean, impute, feature select the data for exporting.
