# Running NoteBook
**Suggested using Anaconda for easy execution of notebook**
1. The main file Training_Testing_Master-Final, is the only file thats is to be run. Other ipynb files are different versions so replicated results should be reserved to the former. The datasets needed are all included in the Datasets folder and the file paths will work automatically when running the notebook. 
2. The submission file will include predictions from test2 with 'rental_id' as index and 'predictions' as the other column.
